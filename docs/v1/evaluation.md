# Evaluation

To evaluate any taskset, use the `eval` entrypoint:

```bash
uv run vf-eval primeintellect/terminal-bench-2
```

You can also use `.toml` files for configuration:

```toml
model = "nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-550B-A55B"

[sampling]
temperature = 1.0

[env.taskset]
id = "primeintellect/terminal-bench-2"

[env.agent.harness]
id = "codex"
version = "0.116.0"

[env.agent.runtime]
type = "docker"
```

Validate the config by using `uv run vf-eval @ config.toml --dry-run`. To run the evaluation, use `uv run vf-eval @ config.toml`.

Use dotted arguments to set values using the CLI, e.g. `--sampling.temperature 0.5`. CLI arguments overwrite toml arguments when both are present.

The output from evaluations are written into `outputs/<env>--<model>--<harness>/<uuid>/` by default, where `<env>` is the taskset, prefixed by the paired env id when `--env.id` sets one (use `output_dir` to overwrite the folder). The folder contains the used `config.toml`, all the episodes in `traces.jsonl`, as well as logs of the run and workers in `logs/attempt_<n>/eval.log` — one directory per launch attempt (a resume starts a new one), with `logs/latest` pointing at the current attempt.

## Common config values

- `model` — the model id to evaluate, e.g. `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Ultra-550B-A55B`
- `sampling` — generation params passed to the model, e.g. `sampling.temperature`
- `env.taskset.id` — pick the taskset (or the positional `eval <taskset-id>`)
- `env.agent.harness.id` — pick the agent's harness (`[env.agent.harness]` in TOML)
- `num_tasks` — how many tasks to evaluate. Not setting a value means all tasks; an
  infinite taskset (a procedural generator, e.g. `wordle`) requires it
- `num_rollouts` — rollouts per task
- `max_concurrent` / `-c` — episodes in flight at once (default: 128)
- `max_agent_runs` — `Agent.run`s in flight at once (`None` = no extra cap)
- `verbose` — log at debug instead of info
- `shuffle` — samples the task order (fixed seed); an error on an infinite taskset
- `rich` — the live dashboard (default); `--no-rich` streams logs to the console and
  prints each trace as JSON at the end
- `rich.show_logs` — replace the dashboard's per-rollout rows with a live tail of the
  attempt's logs (`logs/latest/eval.log`), the env workers' lines included
- `push` — upload the run to the Prime Intellect platform as it goes (default; `--no-push`
  keeps it local). `run.attach <evaluation-id>` streams into a run the platform already
  created instead of opening a new one — this is how a hosted evaluation's sandbox runs
  the same command; it is not something a local run sets by hand

## Resuming evaluations

`--resume <output-dir>` re-runs only the rollouts a previous run left missing or errored, appending to that run's own `traces.jsonl`. It reloads the run's saved `config.toml` verbatim, so it takes no other arguments. Good rollouts are kept, while errored ones are dropped and redone.

## Disabling tools

Almost every harness comes with a `disabled_tools` list, which can be used to disable one or multiple tools:

```toml
[env.agent.harness]
disabled_tools = ["shell_tool"]
```

The names of these tools are set by the respective harness. Consult the relevant documentation for the given harness for the relevant name(s). Some harnesses do not offer support to disable tools.

## Skills

Harnesses whose program supports SKILL.md skills natively (e.g. Claude Code, Codex) take a `skills` list. A local skill folder is uploaded to `<skills dir>/<folder name>`. A `{runtime = "..."}` entry copies the contents of a directory already inside the runtime into the program's skill discovery directory:

```toml
[env.agent.harness]
skills = [{runtime = "/opt/skills"}, "path/to/my-skill"]
```

Tasks can supply the same sources through `TaskData.skills`, for example `skills=[{"runtime": "/opt/skills"}]`. Task sources are installed first, followed by harness sources; later files override matching earlier files. Each run gets its own installed skills. Sources are resolved after task setup, and missing source directories fail the run.

Setting `skills` on a task or harness without native harness skill support fails up front.
